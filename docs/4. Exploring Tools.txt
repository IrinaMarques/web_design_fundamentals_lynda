Choosing a graphics editor
==========================

Web Graphics Requirements:
- You'll need to work with both vector and raster graphics
- Using an editor that can handle both is ideal, but it's not uncommon to use a separate editor for raster and vector
- Your editor should have powerful optimization tools that allow it to export images into the desired formats
-- Having an editor that can represent the states or changes to elements based on user interactivity is extremely helpful

- Photoshop
- Illustrator
- Fireworks
- CorelDRAW
