<p>This is my first web page, it's a little basic, but it's helping me understand how HTML works and how to markup my content.</p>
<button id="color">Change color!</button> <!--id of color-->
<script> // let know that a script will be use
	//inside the current document find an element by its id attribute - color
	//.onclick is an event - when the button is clicked it's going to do something - change color
	document.getElementById('color').onclick = changeColor; 

	//create a variable
	var currentColor = "red"; //variable named currentColor and the value is red

	//name of a function - the code that should run when we call that function
	function changeColor() { 
			//if color is red, let's do something
			if(currentColor == "red" ){ //== checks the value
		document.body.style.color = "green"; //go to the document find the body tag and style the color of the document. If the color is red change it to green
		currentColor = "green";
		//this is what to do if the color is red, if the color is not red - else
			} else {
		document.body.style.color = "red";
		currentColor = "red";
